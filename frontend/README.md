# front_end in R
This is the repository for the implementation of the front-end of my "hello-world" web-application.

The organisation is as follow:
- init__.R runs the front-end logic.
- src groups the source code.

In src the main files are:
- config.R file for storing global variables used in the source code (n.b. external ip is dynamic and needs to be changed manually before running the code).
- run_shiny.R is the main script for running the unser interface and the server logic in Shiny.
